    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Revised: May 2024</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") contain the terms and conditions related to the use of the e-commerce marketing
        software solution provided by TrackSales and include these Terms, the associated Agreement, the Privacy Policy,
        the Data Processing Agreement, and other terms and conditions presented to the Contractor at the time the
        Contractor first uses certain features on the Website. These terms and conditions may be amended by TrackSales
        from time to time.</p>

    <p>By registering, logging in, accessing, or using the software (including any content or information provided in
        connection with the use of the Website or software), the Contractor enters into a legally binding Agreement.
        This Agreement is concluded between TrackSales B.V., registered in the commercial register of the Chamber of
        Commerce under number 12345678, having its registered office in Amsterdam and its place of business at (1011 AA)
        Amsterdam, Example Street no. 123, and the Contractor.</p>

    <p>If the Contractor does not accept these Terms, the associated Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Data Processing
        Agreement, and other terms, they must not register, log in, access, and/or use the software in any way. By
        registering, logging in, accessing, and/or using the software, the Contractor expressly accepts these Terms, the
        associated Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and the Data Processing Agreement.</p>

    <p>The Contractor also confirms that they are over eighteen (18) years old and fully capable and competent to enter
        into these Terms, the Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Data Processing Agreement, and other terms and
        conditions. Consequently, the Website and software are intended for use by adults (eighteen (18) years or older)
        and only for professional purposes (B2B). If the Contractor is under eighteen (18) years old, they are
        prohibited from registering, logging in, accessing, and/or using the software.</p>

    <h2>Article 1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>1.1. In these Terms, the terms have the same meaning as in the Agreement unless expressly stated otherwise.</p>

    <h2>Article 2. Purpose of the Terms</h2>
    <p>2.1. These Terms govern the use of the Website and software. These Terms are binding and must be followed by
        anyone using the Website, whether registered (hereinafter referred to as "User") or using the Website as a
        visitor without registration (hereinafter referred to as "Visitor").</p>
    <p>2.2. Visitors may only view and use certain parts of the information on the Website and may not use the software.
        Visitors must comply with these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>
    <p>2.3. These Terms may be modified or revised in whole or in part at any time without notice. These modifications
        will be posted on the Website, and continued use of the Website after the modifications will constitute
        acceptance of the new Terms by the User or Visitor. If a User or Visitor does not accept these Terms or future
        Terms, they must not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Website and/or software. Any modification
        of the Terms posted on the Website will apply immediately to Users and Visitors.</p>

    <h2>Article 3. Use of the Website and Software</h2>
    <p>3.1. A User must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information to TrackSales. Whenever a User accesses
        and uses the software via the Website, they must log in with the email address and password created during
        registration.</p>
    <p>3.2. Access to the software will be based on the functions, tools, and capabilities of the software chosen by the
        User. The User can upgrade or increase the functions, tools, and capabilities of the software at any time,
        although TrackSales is entitled to withdraw access to the software at any time if the User has reached certain
        capacities. The functions, tools, and capabilities of the software are described on the Website, specifically at
        https://www.tracksales.io. The User must pay fees to TrackSales based on the chosen functions, tools, and
        capabilities of the software.</p>
    <p>3.3. The User will be authorized to:
    <ul>
        <li>upload data into the software, specifically to create a data link between the User's online store and the

    </ul>
    <p>3.4. TrackSales will have the right to introduce new services on the Website and to modify these Terms

        messages - via the email address provided by the Users during registration - regarding the software and any new
        services offered, or other relevant topics that TrackSales believes may enhance the Users' experience. These
        messages may include reminders, invitations, suggestions, descriptions of existing, new, or future services,

    <h2>Article 4. General Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>4.1. All Visitors and Users acknowledge and agree that TrackSales has no obligation to monitor (although it has

    <h2>Article 6. Prohibitions</h2>
    <p>6.1. The User declares and guarantees that the content of the data link between the User's online store and the
        software does not in any way infringe the rights of third parties, broadly speaking. The User is therefore
        expressly prohibited from uploading data violating the privacy of third parties. Furthermore, the User is

        violates applicable laws or regulations or damages the reputation of TrackSales in any way.</p>

    <p>6.4. Furthermore, both the Visitor and the User are prohibited from using robots, click farms, fake clicks, or
        other automated or manual techniques to mimic, simulate, or otherwise generate user activity on the Website

    <p>6.8. In the event of a violation of one or more provisions of this article by the User, the User shall owe
        TrackSales an immediately payable penalty of €50,000.00 (fifty thousand euros) plus a penalty of €5,000.00 (five

    <h2>Article 7. Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Data Processing Agreement</h2>

        available to them, that they have read and accepted their content and validity regarding these Terms and all
        subsequent conditions.</p>
    <p>7.3. Between these Terms and Conditions and the Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and the Data Processing Agreement,
        the following order of priority will apply in case of conflict: (i) Agreement, then (ii) Terms and Conditions,
        then (iii) Data Processing Agreement, and then (iv) Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>Article 8. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>8.1. The agreements to which these Terms apply and subsequent agreements arising from them will be governed
        exclusively by Dutch law.</p>
    <p>8.2. If the User is established in the European Economic Area (hereinafter "EEA"), all disputes arising from the
        Agreement and all resulting agreements between the Parties to which these Terms apply will be resolved

    <p>8.3. If the User is not established in the EEA, all disputes arising from the Agreement and all resulting
        agreements between the Parties to which these Terms apply will be resolved exclusively in accordance with the
        Arbitration Rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute (NAI). The arbitral tribunal will be composed of one
        arbitrator, who will be appointed according to the list procedure. The place of arbitration will be Amsterdam.
        The proceedings will be conducted in English, and the arbitral tribunal will decide in accordance with Dutch
        law.</p>
